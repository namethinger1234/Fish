						<br>
						<p>The Flying Fish is born out of a love for the many East Texas Fish Joints available on area lakes, especially Caddo Lake. We sell gobs of fresh catfish, shrimp and oysters, grilled fish, shrimp cocktail, fish cocktail, crab legs, burgers, chicken and mudbugs (crawfish) in season. A specialty selection of grilled salmon, trout or tilapia is also offered each day. Ice cold Tap and bottled Beer, wine and home made margaritas are also served.</p>
				
						
						<br>
						<p>We offer more than just a wide selection of fish. </p>
						<br>
						<p>We have great hamburgers, chicken tenders and fresh salads galore. If you want us to top your salad with a piece of grilled fish, we have that too.
						We also give the customers the chance to participate in the “Liars Wall” – bring in a photo of YOU with your big catch and lie about it’s size!!!! – and we are the Home of the world’s first Billy Bass Adoption Wall. Any customer who donates a Billy Bass receives a FREE BASKET OF CATFISH, along with his or her name on a wall plaque and we promise to house, shelter, love and protect each ADOPTED Billy Bass.</p>
						
						
						<br>
						<p>We look forward to meeting your whole family (PS, we have KIDS BOATS for your minnows!)</p>
